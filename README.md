## Book Description

Agile w/ Blueprints is a lightweight yet comprehensive process for building production-quality business applications.  Evolved and refined over 20 years, it applies proven best practices for smallâ€”to medium-sized teams to quickly and efficiently develop software solutions that solve business problems.

Agile w/ Blueprints Quick Start is a sample business application that demonstrates the process, complete with blueprints, implementation code, automated system tests, and project management artifacts. Teams study the sample app, which illustrates how the blueprints drive construction and sprint increments drive the blueprints. 

In addition, software teams develop Agile w/ Blueprints skills by working together to enhance the sample application. Members assume their role(s) and update the sample blueprints throughout the course of a sprint.
